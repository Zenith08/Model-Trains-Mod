# The Model Trains Mod for Minecraft

![Showcase Logo](/docs/train-figure-8.png)

Throughout the years pretty much everything has been modded into Minecraft, but the one that I always enjoyed was the Train Mods. While they were a blast to play with though, it was always tough if at all possible to find a working mod with moving trains. My answer was to make the Model trains Mod.

## Whats Included
The mod includes 1 engine, some passanger carrages, cabooses, and a freight carriage. My interest has always been the code component so the modeling and texturing took a back seat. Add to that that Minecrafts model system is constantly changing and the result is not as many trains as one might hope for.

Furthermore, the mod includes the 3D printer which allows the user to create trains in survival mode and customize the colour of their train carriages.

## Contributing / Extending
At this point, I have chosen to move on from Minecraft to other interests. That's not to say the mod is *abandoned* just that I'm not activly developing it at this time. If you would like to expand it their are two options:
- Modify the existing source code to update it or add features.
- Use the API features provided by the mod to add your own trains.

While not perfect, the mod contians interfaces for all major aspects. By simply implementing those and registering a new train through the Train Registry, it is possible for any mod to add their own trains to the system.

## Modpacks and Liscencing
Whether you want to contribute, want to use the mod in a modpack, or something else the basic answer for liscencing is this:
- I don't want to have my mod become disconnected from me, so if you use it, give me credit.
- I don't want to take away credit from you, so if you contribute or extend it, let me know so I can include it on Github or Curseforge.
- I don't plan to proffit from this, so modpacks and the like are alright as long as you link to [Github](https://github.com/Zenith08/Model-Trains-Mod) or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/model-trains-mod).
